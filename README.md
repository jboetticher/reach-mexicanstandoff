# Mexican Standoff - Reach
This is a game made in reach, where three players gamble to see if they can win in a Mexcan Standoff.  
You should be familiar with Reach before attempting to run it. [Here](https://docs.reach.sh/tut-1.html) are requirements for running reach programs.  
Follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jlboetticher) if you want updates / contact me.

## Running
First, run `./npm install`.  
Now, here's the jank part. Go into node_modules and DELETE the `react` folder.  
Use `./reach react` to run the program.  

## Charity
The charity that's being used is known as [Potato Coin](https://twitter.com/PotatoCoins). It was chosen due to convenience on the algorand network, 
and as of writing it is currently still pending a nonprofit status. Permission was recieved to use their organization within the program. Please 
contact me if you would like to be added as a charity. You must have an Algorand address to donate to.

## Game Connection
Currently, only manual connection is available. After creating a game, send the address (with the quotation marks) in the bottom left to your friends 
so that they can connect to your game.

## Notes
- Adblocker may block images and sounds.
- Inactivity of any party will result in either returning funds or automatic donation.
- This is currently an MVP. Further development will occur if people like it enough.
- It can also be compiled to ethereum with small modifications.
- If too many things are overlapping, try zooming out. I didn't have enough time to make optimized UI...
- Speed is based off of blockchain
